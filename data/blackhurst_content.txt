Executive Summary

The Blackhurst Cultural Centre (BCC) - The People's Residence  - is a non-profit nexus and destination that celebrates the rich culture and history of Canadians of African and Caribbean descent. Situated in the renowned Bathurst-Bloor ("Blackhurst") area of Toronto, BCC invites the public to explore remarkable narratives through literature, drama, music, dance, visual arts, and community learning and other events. BCC is co-located with A Difference Booklist bookstore, an institution that has been a beacon in the long history of activism, Black economic autonomy, community development and cultural guardianship in Toronto. 
In collaboration with the City of Toronto and Westbank Corporation, BCC is working to construct a new facility with a heritage façade at 756 Bathurst Street, just south of the Bloor and Bathurst intersection. The site holds great historical significance, and is integrated into the soon-to-be-completed Mirvish Village mega development project, and will emerge as one of the most dynamic, Black-led cultural hubs in the country. 
The new BCC permanent home will boast 8,300 square feet. As a community and cultural hub, it will span four floors of flexible multi-purpose space to support programming and activities across arts and culture activities and disciplines. Its storefront visibility and ground floor public access along Bathurst maximises its accessibility to its members of multiple generations and identities, attracting pedestrians and serving as a key placemaking attraction for the Mirvish Village redevelopment.
By uniting various programs and spaces under one roof, the BCC will nurture, enable, and magnify the history, culture, and multidisciplinary art forms of Black artists, organisations, businesses and allies. The bookstore, A Different Booklist, will remain co-located as a subtenant in the new facility, generating an income stream to support programming and operations. The new home will allow BCC to provide expanded and diverse opportunities for artists, professional arts organisations, entrepreneurs and residents through its versatile and responsive programming, affordable rental spaces, free offerings, and networking opportunities offered by its extensive community and nonprofit arts partnerships.
The bold vision of this business plan is to allow our Elders the opportunity  to dance into a building they have imagined before they transition; and to provide our Children a model of how to achieve much together. To move the organisation from tenant to resident, from temporary to permanent and from hope to accomplishment is the critical step in the journey of Black presence in Canada that both inspires our children and allows us to save face with them.

History


Deborah Brown's arrival in Canada in the 1860s via the Underground Railroad represents a significant moment in the history of Black Canadians. The Underground Railroad was a network of secret routes and safe houses used by enslaved African Americans to escape to freedom in the American North and in Canada. It was a dangerous and difficult journey, but for those who made it to safety, it represented a new beginning and a chance for a better life.

Deborah Brown's settlement in a house at 691 Markham Street in Toronto is also a significant moment in the history of the recently renamed City of Toronto (formerly Town of York or ‘dirty little York’). This is believed to be the earliest known fixed Black presence in the Annex neighbourhood, and it represents a tangible link to the city's cultural history and heritage. Brown's presence in the neighbourhood would have been a powerful symbol of hope and possibility for other Black Canadians who were also seeking to build a new life in a new country.

The arrival of Deborah Brown and other African Americans to Toronto and other Canadian cities in the 19th century marked the beginning of a long and difficult struggle for equality and justice. Despite facing discrimination, racism, and prejudice, these new Black Canadians contributed significantly to the cultural, economic, and social fabric of their new country. Today, the legacy of the Underground Railroad and the bravery of those who followed “the North Star to freedom” continues to inspire and inform our understanding of Canadian history and identity.

In the 1960s, the Home Service Organisation and the “Black Library” was located at 941 Bathurst Street.
In 1968, the Third World Books and Crafts was launched and operated until the late 1990s at its Bathurst Street location.
In 1995, Dr. Wesley Crichlow, a professor of Caribbean Canadian & LGBTQ2S+ Studies, established A Different Booklist, a bookstore that focused on academic texts related to 2SLGBTQI+ related studies. In 1998, Itah Sadu and Miguel San Vicente purchased the bookstore, which now features a wide range of African and Caribbean literature across various genres.
Both Sadu and San Vicente are award-winning entrepreneurs and community builders, recognized for their innovative programs by organisations such as the Ontario Ministry of Tourism and the Toronto Arts Council Foundation. They have received the African Canadian Achievement Award for Business Excellence and the 2016 Premier's Award for Excellence in the Arts. As a community developer and a best-selling children's book author, Itah Sadu has established youth programs, including Fresh Elements/ Fresh Arts for the Province of Ontario. She has been honoured with numerous artistic and community leadership awards.
In 2013, Westbank Corporation purchased the Honest Ed's site, leading to the Mirvish Village redevelopment project now under construction. 
In 2015, the A Different Booklist bookstore formalised its role as a cultural community hub by incorporating a separate non-profit entity, A Different Booklist Cultural Centre – The People's Residence to celebrate that history of the Bathurst and Bloor location as a focal point for the African and Caribbean diaspora in Toronto. 
In 2022, A Different Booklist Cultural Centre was renamed the Blackhurst Cultural Centre (BCC) – The Peoples Residence to reflect the place-making legacy of this neighbourhood. The resonance and power of Blackhurst continue to inform and inspire the community's vision for the future of the iconic and historically significant neighbourhood. After consultations with the City of Toronto and support from Westbank, the City acquired 756 Bathurst Street as one of the 24 historic buildings to be preserved within Mirvish Village. After 22 years at the same location.

In 2017, the bookstore and cultural centre relocated from 746 Bathurst Street due to the property being part of the Honest Ed's block that was sold. As a demonstration of its unique relationship with the community and its customers, the bookstore relied on them to move boxes of books to its new location at 777 & 779 Bathurst Street, on the ground floor of the new B.Streets Condo development on the east side of Bathurst.

Leadership & Governance

Blackhurst Cultural Centre is governed by a 9-member Board of Directors who each self-identify as Black. They are from various professional backgrounds and bring a wealth of experiences from other non-profit organisations in areas such as: policy development, program development, finance and accounting, risk management, children and youth, social justice issues, education, arts and culture, community organising, public policy issues, community development and the education system. The Board or the Executive Committees meet monthly and hold an annual General Meeting.
The board of directors is made up of 9 members (see Appendix ‘A’ - Biographies of Key Persons): 
Judy Brooks, Chair

Shannon Ashman, Vice-Chair

Loris Thomas, Secretary

John Brathwaite, Treasurer

Nigel Barriffe, Board Member

Stanley Julien, Board Member

Michael G.A. Lashley, Board Member

Ivor Picou, Board Member

Angela Pierre, Board Member




Services and Programs

Toronto’s cultural offerings have long been recognized to be among the city’s strongest competitive advantages. The Centre believes that the definition of Toronto’s vibrant cultural life must include diverse offerings that appeal to the widest array of the city’s residents and visitors. BCC adds to the city’s vibrant cultural life by presenting the unique and rich cultural offerings of the African and Caribbean Canadian communities. While it prides itself that BCC is an iconic destination here in Toronto, we are most proud of the work behind the scenes to foster youth leadership, document a neighbourhood’s history, promote community well-being and launch innovation.
BCC’s varied programming includes:
Readings
Book launches
Musical performances
Visual art and material culture exhibitions
Keynote Lectures
Panel discussions
Community learning & educational events
Youth engagement events
Walking tours
Emancipation events
Networking events
The new facility will allow BCC to expand its community programs, with the reach of in-person and virtual programs expected to grow from the current 14,400 to 20,000 people annually by its first full year of operations at 756 Bathurst, stabilising to over 35,000 people annually by the third year of operations. The current professional arts and cultural offerings include:
 
Artists in Community allows an artist to be on-site to work on a time limited project; creating different pieces of work for BCC. General public is invited to presentations or performances.
“Dinner With . . .”  Series provides participants the opportunity to share dinner and conversation with trailblazers and game changers. Thirty guests have the opportunity to engage, initiate, learn, and share information on various topics.
Collaborative and Partnerships Initiatives includes co-productions and co-sponsored activities with a wide range of non-profit groups, educators, public institutions, and private sector businesses. These initiatives have included storytelling events, arts exhibitions, book launches, student placements, networking sessions, mentorships, workshops, professional development sessions, art classes, Filling the Gap joint fundraising support during COVID, Schulich School of Business, etc.
The Emancipation Day "Underground Freedom Train” Ride is symbolic of the role of the Underground Railroad within Canada's history. This train ride is a recognition of the historic date of Emancipation Day on August 1st when slavery was abolished in the British Empire. BCC partners with the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) and the train route travels along the TTC subway from Union Station to Sheppard West Station. This annual event is open to the public and may include poetry readings, musical entertainment, networking, and special activities.
Entrepreneurship – Pop-Up Experience helps to guide entrepreneurs from the idea/concept to the showcasing and sale of their products. This experience offers entrepreneurs and/or designers an opportunity to learn about customer service, merchandising, branding, marketing, on-line services and selling.
Literary Festivals present and animate the works of Black and Caribbean writers in Canada and the diaspora. Currently, the Caribbean & Black Book Affair is a month-long festival held in the fall.
The Writing Master Class is a program for writers, journalists, illustrators, and authors to gather, create, co-create, collaborate and showcase works in progress and completed work. This regular event offers writers the opportunity to workshop their stories and to network with publishers and other literary practitioners.
The People’s Podcast provides an opportunity to document content from other BCC programs, and to maintain our past and living history and culture in a structured archive that is available online.
Steel Pan Instruction is an 8-week class of steelpan instruction in collaboration with the award-winning Pan Fantasy Steel Band that provides introductory and advanced classes that are open to everyone.
Storytelling Classes is a  5-week class to introduce storytelling as an oral art form which includes voice memory and the sense of proper occasion.
Visual Arts Expression Classes is a 6-week session to give students an outlet to express their creativity through various media, and to document how they see and communicate with the world around them.
The Walk with Excellence event is an urban rite-of-passage of moving graduating high school students to post-secondary education. The Walk's objective is to demonstrate student achievement and academic success. Similar themed processions happen annually across the City of Toronto as well as in Ottawa, Ontario. These processions comprise students, school principals, teachers, family, and partners.
The Welcome to Blackhurst program engages and educates all Canadians – particularly students – to the rich legacy of the history-makers of Toronto’s Bathurst-Bloor and Annex neighbourhoods. It incorporates hands-on activities that readily connect participants to the local history of the surrounding community. Visitors have participated in walking tours of the neighbourhood, coffee ceremonies, workshops, sing-a-longs with musicians, and listened to history lectures of this iconic neighbourhood.
The Windows to Opportunity (WTO) is a 28-week program that supports the positive development of Black youth through mentorships with professional artists. The WTO program provides hands-on learning in five different fields of study: computer graphics/animation, dance, event planning, media arts and stand-up comedy.
Business e-Certificate is a 10-week course delivered in partnership with the Schulich School of Business at York University. It covers the basics of business for entrepreneurs and youth in the community. The course contributes to the BCC objectives of decolonizing the business curriculum, and providing students with role models who can relate to experience and perspectives as Black people.
Going forward, community learning and educational offerings will be managed under the new “Blackhurst Academy” unit.

Links to the Community

Benefits to the Community

BCC strives to excel as:
A platform to build, grow and sustain a home for the cultural legacy of African and Caribbean Canadians;
A physical and virtual place of welcome, inclusion and dialogue for neighbours, Torontonians, and international visitors;
A hub of opportunity to support the development of individuals and artists through mentorship, skills development, and spaces and programs to showcase their work and products; and, 
A home where community and strategic partners collaborate to enhance the wellbeing of African and Caribbean Canadian communities, while enriching the cultural fabric of Canadian society.

Community Support

The City of Toronto and Westbank held consultations with the community about the new Mirvish Village development. BCC was among the stronger advocates for the broader definition of heritage, from building-centric to cultural heritage that includes by is not limited to buildings. 
BCC actively participated in the consultations, and noted that residents and local organisations spontaneously spoke to the need to have BCC included in the new development. For example, the importance of including the BCC in the new Mirvish Village was regularly advocated as part of the Jane Jacobs tours of the neighbourhood. Participants in the consultations included: Mirvish BIA, the late Leo Panitch who represented the local tenants, the Annex Gleaner, Randolph College for the Performing Arts, Bloor Street Cultural Corridor, Hot Docs, and the various laneway committees that make up the Annex neighbourhood. 

Filmmaker Lulu Wei featured the BCC in her award-winning documentary film about the neighbourhood’s redevelopment. Since its release, the film There's No Place Like This Place, Anyplace has garnered success through different film festivals and broadcast by CBC.
The extraordinarily strong and passionate support for providing BCC a permanent place in the redevelopment is also evidenced by patrons and community members volunteering to physically move its book inventory across the street, when it moved from 746 Bathurst Street to 777 & 779 Bathurst Street in 2017. 
The response of the City of Toronto to this overwhelming community support resulted in  exceptional City support, recorded in three City of Toronto Council motions: on December 15, 2021 to declare 756 Bathurst Street surplused and to dispose of the building by way of a long-term lease to BCC (see Appendix ‘B’), on April 7, 2021 to allow the City to accept donation revenue on behalf of BCC for the capital project (see Appendix ‘C’), and on May 11, 2022 to change the scope of the project to include demolition and a new building with heritage façade at 756 Bathurst Street (see Appendix ‘D’). A June 17, 2022 City ‘Report for Action’ also recommended that the City enter into a Municipal Capital Facility Agreement (MCFA) with BCC. MCFA agreements typically involve the municipal government borrowing funds to finance a capital project, with the provincial or federal government or private lender providing the funding. They are often used by municipalities to finance capital projects by spreading the cost over a longer period of time, making them more manageable and affordable (see Appendix ‘E’).
Councillors Mike Layton, Joe Cressy and Michael Thompson were champions in this process. The motion allows Blackhurst to demolish the existing building, and build a new purpose-build 4 floor community cultural centre that preserves its heritage façade. 

At the operational level, BCC works closely with the department of Economic Development and Culture (EDC) as the lead of an inter-divisional City staff team to assist BCC with navigating City processes, permits and procedures. This resulted in commitments from the City of $2.78 million (CAD) in capital contributions, waived permit fees, and an agreement that it would accept donations on behalf of BCC in exchange of donor tax receipts.  
Since the very beginnings of their project, BCC has been working closely with the developer Westbank to promote the values of the communities it serves in the $350 million Mirvish Village development. Specifically, BCC buried 1,000 time capsules in the foundation of the new development, requested and allotted affordable housing units for redistribution to community members in need, and is coordinating a process to select local artists to render an artistic wall. In addition to the above, BCC introduced the developer with diverse community groups and vendors to enrich the neighbourhood. 



The New Facility

BCC and A Different Booklist are currently operating in a 2,000 square feet of contiguous space, comprising a community meeting area, the bookstore, and an administrative area. The new facility at 756 Bathurst Street represents more than 8,300 square feet, with approximately 5,400 square feet of usable space, therefore increasing the opportunity for reach and impact. It will be a modern multipurpose space (see Appendix ‘F’).



Ground Lease

City staff and BCC are negotiating in good faith to fulfil the wishes of City Council to provide BCC with a new and permanent home. Once the building was deemed as unsuitable for repair, the capital project changed from a renovation to a demolition and rebuild project with a heritage façade component. As such, the nature of the lease must change from a building lease to a ground lease upon which a new structure will be built. The lease negotiations are ongoing. It is imperative that they conclude successfully to allow for permit issuance in early Summer 2023.

Time Frame

The BCC capital project was intended to be fully implemented within the UN International Decade for People of African Descent, ending on December 31, 2024. As a result of delays detailed below, and due to the COVID pandemic, the current construction schedule estimates that full occupancy will occur in May 2025. 
Over the life of the project, projected capital costs have risen from approximately $8 million to approximately $13.8 million, primarily due to the following factors: 
Due diligence led by BCC resulted in an Opinion of Existing Condition that was subsequently accepted by the City as part of the site plan approval documents submitted to the City (see Appendix ‘G’). The determination that the building is unfit for occupancy due to serious structural problems that require the building to be demolished and a new building constructed. As such, the project changed from a renovation project to a new build project. This resulted in substantive architectural and other planning work undertaken by a large team of building professionals on behalf and at the expense of BCC (see Appendix ‘H’ for list of drawings).

756 Bathurst Street is among the remaining commercial buildings designed by T.W. Wilson built circa 1890. Subsequent to the Council Motion (see Appendix ‘D’), a heritage impact assessment by the City resulted in a heritage designation on the façade of the building. As such, Heritage Planning required a heritage façade panelization plan that will preserve, restore and reinstall the east elevation masonry of the building. This scope change was captured in a second City Council motion dated May 11, 2022 (see Appendix ‘D’) :
“Blackhurst Cultural Centre will be a purpose-built cultural centre led by A Different Booklist Cultural Centre, in partnership with the City of Toronto. Blackhurst Cultural Centre will provide permanent, affordable, accessible space for Black artistic and cultural production in Toronto. Blackhurst Cultural Centre will provide opportunities to experience the rich culture and history of Canadians of African and Caribbean ancestry, as a bookstore, non-profit hub and destination.

The City is committed to supporting the future of this important Black cultural centre. Economic Development and Culture is leading an inter-divisional team to assist A Different Booklist Cultural Centre with navigating City planning, heritage, building, funding and legal processes. In December 2021, City Council authorized the Executive Director, Corporate Real Estate Management to negotiate and enter into a 49-year below-market rent lease agreement between the City and Blackhurst Cultural Centre, in respect of 756 Bathurst Street.

The scope of capital improvements has been substantially adjusted since the inception of the project. The project scope will now include the complete demolition of the existing building, and removal of the heritage facade through panelization, preservation and reincorporation into the final building design as part of an entirely new building.

Providing additional fee relief for the Blackhurst Cultural Centre supports goals of the Toronto Action Plan to Confront Anti-Black Racism, including supporting Black arts and culture, and leveraging City spaces to create a Black community hub in partnership with Black service providers.”
This item represents an additional cost of approximately $2.6 million. Cost escalations due to increases in the cost of trades and materials through general inflation.
The full occupancy time frame of Spring 2025 falls outside of the UN Decade for People of African Descent, and is premised on a construction start of October 2023 that assumes a positive response from the GICB program at Infrastructure Canada (or an alternate funding source) by early Fall 2023. It also requires timely approval of City permits and related documents.  However, if the lease, permits and funding were accelerated, the project could still achieve substantial completion within the UN International Decade for People of African Descent. It is also critical to maintain a tight construction schedule so as to avoid unnecessary disruptions to our neighbours, the new tenants of the Mirvish Village, and the operations of the adjacent Niagara College.
Building Specifications and Features 
The design incorporates a mix of specialised and flexible spaces across four floors designed to accommodate a mix of artistic practices, workshops, community cultural events and gatherings. This will include spaces for programming, performance, and meeting. It will also accommodate the independent bookstore (A Different Booklist) as a tenant, an art gallery space, a drumming studio, a recording/podcast studio, pop-up space for cultural entrepreneurs, and administrative space.
Music room/Drumming Studio (250 sq ft).  One of the most highly requested spaces BCC heard in its outreach is the need for a soundproofed drumming studio for African, hip-hop, and steel pan culture.  Its location in the lower level will further attenuate sound and vibration, providing the ability for groups up to 20 to practise musical art forms that have few places for practice and rehearsals. 
Multi-Purpose Meeting and Program Room (415 sq ft) will provide a flexible configuration and professional, AV-equipped space for arts organisations and local residents to host board meetings of 20, educational workshops for 40 people or more.  The room will also be programmable for exhibits, videos, or other uses during all-building festivals and events.  Access will be enhanced through flexible rental options from 2-hour increments to all day use. 
Art Gallery (700 sq ft)  BCC will work with local curators, including university partners, to provide exhibition opportunities for artists of the African diaspora as well as shows that celebrate African and Caribbean culture, provoke awareness, and dialogue, and showcase the work of artists who have faced barriers to sharing and exhibiting their work.  An acoustic separator will allow for division of the space to support multiple shows or concurrent events.  The gallery will be a signature space of the Cultural Centre.
Podcast/Meeting Room (150 sq ft)  Community consultations also guided BCC to incorporate a small but fully soundproof and equipped booth for recording and podcasts that would be affordable and accessible to our organisational and community partners recording podcasts and other recordings or needing a space for mixing. 
Multipurpose Venue (635 sq ft) – The third floor will feature a state of the art gathering space with natural light and views of the neighbourhood.  It will be an intimate space to host musical and dance performances, readings, spoken word, and movie screenings as well as a venue for special events, workshops, and gatherings.
Community Room/Studio (270 sq ft) this space on the third floor has been designed to support meetings, artists’ classes and other gatherings.
Cultural Centre Storefront Reception The Cultural Centre will front Bathurst with a storefront reception area that will have information, staff and volunteers on hand, and a kiosk of items for sale by local artists. 
Kitchenette.  A space on the 2nd floor that will be accessible by hub staff and tenants as well as a preparation/warming space for catering during receptions, events, and performances.
Common Areas. The remaining space will be allocated to common areas, public washrooms, including universal, gender-neutral washrooms, storage and IT space and to a small office for BCC staff and volunteers.
A Different Booklist (915 sq ft) will be a tenant that attracts customers and visitors who will explore BCC to take advantage of its exhibits and general programming.

Project Scope & Risks

Following repeated requests from BCC to Real Estate Services for a building condition assessment that were left unanswered, the architects retained by BCC prepared an Opinion of Current Conditions that identified two key shortfalls: accessibility (non-compliant to AODA, and insufficient exits for the assembly use. Also, the current structure has inadequate mechanical systems. To seek to redress these deficiencies via a renovation would be prohibitively expensive, costing much more that demolition and a new build. Therefore, the structure was deemed unsuitable for retrofitting; this assessment was accepted by the City and reflected in a new Council motion (see Appendices ‘G’ and ‘D’).
Requirements of a site plan agreement from the City is also premised on the assessment that the current structure and incoming services (water, electricity, sewer) are inadequate for the new required assembly use as an arts and cultural centre open to the public. This resulted in a substantial body of work over four (4) years that is premised on a new build.

Risks and Mitigation				
There are three key risks associated with the BCC capital project:

The non-execution of the lease with the City of Toronto;
The inability of BCC to raise capital required to undertake the project; 
A construction schedule that projects occupancy outside of the UN International Decade for People of African Descent, ending on December 31, 2024;
Failing to execute on the new build project; and,  
The potential advent of the COVID-19.
The First Risk relates to the non-execution of the lease. Since BCC and the City initiated lease negotiations, the scope of the project has changed from the renovation of an existing building, to the demolition of the existing structure and new build project. The scope also expanded to include the preservation of the façade that subsequently received a heritage designation. When negotiations began, the lease was for a renovated building. Given this scope change, the parties must now negotiate a ground lease rather than a building lease.
Mitigation. The timely full execution of a ground lease and accelerated approvals for permits are required for BCC to achieve its fundraising goals (see “second risk”) and also to obtain the required construction permits to stay on target for a meaningful celebration of the new BCC home within the UN International Decade for People of African Descent (see “third risk”). Based on current timelines, complete occupancy is projected for Spring 2025. 

The Second Risk relates to the potential inability of BCC to raise the total amount of $13,743,355 required to complete the project. 

Mitigation. To date, BCC and its partners have contributed over $250,000 in fees and in-kind on planning, fundraising and other professional services in support of the realisation of the capital project. The $13.8 million capital cost represents funds required to remove the heritage façade, demolish the existing structure, build the new structure, and reapply the refurbished heritage façade. To date, the City of Toronto has committed $2.78 million and BCC has secured or committed to raise $1.71 million for a total of $4.49 million (see the Fundraising Plan). 

In February 2023, armed with a support letter from the City, BCC submitted a $7.84 million funding request to the Infrastructure Canada’s Green and Inclusive Community Buildings Program (GICB).  BCC has met all formal requirements for the GICB funding. The risk mitigation strategy is to work with the City and Westbank as partners to communicate to the federal government the importance of this funding for the communities that BCC serve, the completion of the $350 million Mirvish Village redevelopment project, and to the City of Toronto’s diverse and Black-led arts and cultural scenes. 

With the GICB  funding secured, a shortfall of approximately $1.5 million remains. BCC submitted an application for $2.5 million to Heritage Canada’s Cultural Spaces Fund. This funding will close the funding gap and allow for approximately $1 million of additional funding as a contingency. BCC has also engaged the provincial government as a source of potential alternate capital funding, and future operating funding.

The Third Risk relates to a construction schedule that projects occupancy outside of the UN International Decade for People of African Descent, ending on December 31, 2024.

Mitigation. Based on current timelines, complete occupancy is projected for Spring 2025. However, it is still feasible to organise a meaningful celebration of the second day of Kwanzaa (“Day of Self-Determination or Kugichagulia”) on December 27, 2024. This celebration will be within the UN International Decade for People of African Descent. 

The fourth risk relates to failing to execute on the new build project, creating an “eye sore” on the eastern perimeter of the Mirvish Village development project. The budget for this 1,336,957 sq ft project was reported at $350 million, before delays. It should be noted that the federal government announced a $200 million contribution to the Mirvish Village development project in support of affordable housing. 

Mitigation. The capital project management team (see Appendix ‘D’ for membership) is currently in discussions with construction management representatives from Westbank to explore opportunities to leverage their existing site mobilisation and equipment (cranes particularly) to assist with our construction, and to use part of their larger site for our construction staging. Also related to site access and the limiting factor of the heritage façade to be retained on the Bathurst Street frontage, we have approached our heritage consultants to explore the possibility of cataloguing, dismantling and re-assembling the heritage façade to allow for unrestricted site access to obviate the more costly and obstructive temporary support infrastructure that would otherwise be required to support the façade during construction. With respect to the third risk, our structural engineers are conducting investigations to assess the condition of the existing demising partition between 756 and 758 Bathurst Street to determine how to best integrate it with the new construction with minimal disruption.

A Fifth Risk is the potential advent of the COVID-19 as a significant and immediate health and safety risk to the workforce and consequently the construction schedule in the event of an outbreak and a result shut-down. Additional to this is the potential for work-place accidents due to compromised health and wellness of construction personnel in the event of an occurrence.

Mitigation. It is imperative to proactively establish and strictly adhere to COVID-19 safety protocols. An advisory team led by the project manager will be established to ensure that the health and safety protocols are strictly adhered to and to coordinate site specific COVID-19 responses. The team will continually evaluate this risk as circumstances are continually changing and will review and update work procedures, schedule continuity, emergency preparedness and response plans according to the risk. These procedures will involve smaller teams and shift work for trade workers to ensure social distancing and frequent deep-cleaning of common areas to ensure safety. 


			

Energy Efficiency



The Zero Carbon Building – Design Standard v3 (ZCB-Design v3) is a Canada Green Building Council certification. To meet this certification, the new building needed to stay below 100 kWh/m2 for Office and 90kWh/m2 for Retail.
The BCC-approved design optimises heating and cooling to reduce projected energy consumption below the required threshold to 72.1 kWh/m2 (see Appendix ‘I’). 







Financial Summaries & Funding Sources

Operating Budget, 2023 - 2024



After 28 years of operation, BCC is more than a tenant, more than a temporary presence in the neighbourhood. Today, BCC serves more than 14,000 annually, including about 2,000 recent immigrants helped.  All this is done on a shoestring budget, going from grant to grant, and in the absence of the permanence of a permanent home. This is the current state.

Today, BCC is at an inflection point, as it works towards a future state with a permanent home that almost triples its usable space footprint. This provides a historical opportunity to scale up and diversify programming to meet the needs of its diverse and growing audiences. It also provides BCC an opportunity to diversify revenue streams through new paid offerings such as courses, and through facilities rentals. 

BCC expects to grow its annual reach to over 20,000 people by its first complete year in its new permanent home, growing its associated operating budget from about $700,000 to over $1.5 million annually. The savings associated with the current rental alone represent $120,000 that will be reinvested in programming and supporting human resources. The sources of funds mix is also expected to be recalibrated with a larger portion of incoming funds from earned revenue. 


Capital Budget

	* Awaiting a decision


To date, BCC raised or committed to raising a total of $1.71 million. In addition to its many contributions acknowledged throughout this document, the City of Toronto committed $2.78 million towards the BCC capital project. It also provided a strong support letter for inclusion as part of the GICB application (see Appendix ‘J’). If the GICB and Heritage Canada applications are successful, BCC will have a $1 million buffer for unanticipated cost escalations and/or unforeseen expenses (for example, what may be found in the soil once the demolition of the existing structure is completed).



Conclusion

An iconic neighbourhood requires iconic stories. 

BCC is proud to welcome Candians and visitors to its Centre, at 777 Bathurst Street, at Bloor  to engage with the African - Canadian and Caribbean experience. It continues to show leadership and lasting power, being the only business that remained in the neighbourhood through the transition to the new Mirvish Village. We look forward to our new home in the new Village.  

Due to its cluster collaboration model, BCC attracts the best expertise to deliver projects and programming to catalyze Canadian cultural industries. The organisation's demonstrated ability to pivot and respond to the changing needs of the communities it serves is core to its longevity. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, BCC programming migrated to on-line without losing relevance. BCC's performance during COVID was testimony to its resilience and quest for longevity and sustainability.  

We are proud to be intergenerational. A space where youth can drop in at any time to support their aspirations through placement opportunities and employment, and where other age groups find events and programming that reflect their interests. As a Black-led space that welcomes everyone, equity-deserving groups can expect to continue to be have experiences that seek to eliminate barriers, including attitudinal, economic, environmental, historic, and/or social barriers based on age, sex, ethnicity, disability, economic status, family status, race, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, etc. 

BCC's is a new narrative of  Canadian community-centric redevelopment, turning gentrification into inclusive development. A case study of the response of community and development. A study of a community's location, of African-Canadian mapping across Canada, a good news story, that has impacted lives in positive ways. We are a case study of building on legacy rather than erasing what is uncomfortable about our shared past. A case study of Canadian Cultural Heritage.  

The realisation of this project is critical to preserving and building on Black and wider community narratives in the following ways:
Provide a gathering place that is safe where people feel valued a have a sense of belonging e.g. youth and seniors;
Access opportunities that are culturally-specific where the participants/visitors needs are heard and respected;
Break the stereotypes about young people and the Black community;
Encourage youth leadership in arts and culture utilising traditional and contemporary media;
Support community priorities and interests; and,
Present the works of Black artists and cultural entrepreneurs to the public.

We want to acknowledge the project management team and all our supporters who have gotten us this far towards BCC’s new permanent home (see Appendices ‘K’ and ‘L’).

Fundraising Plan
Black Lives Matter.   Black Spaces Matter.   Black Infrastructure Matters.  



May 2023


	
				
					



Executive Summary

The fundraising plan is premised on a long-standing executive structure, Black-led governance model and established planned activities that directly build on 28 years of successful operational history.
Blackhurst Cultural Centre (BCC) is at an inflection point in its history. The launch of the $350 million Mirvish Village development project presented the opportunity for a new BCC permanent home.  Since 2016, BCC has been working closely with the City of Toronto and the real estate developer Westbank Corporation to construct a new 8,300 square feet facility with a heritage façade at 756 Bathurst Street. This facility will be part of the eastern perimeter of the
In order to successfully complete the capital project, and to fully realize its positive potential for the neighbourhood and city-wide community,  BCC has developed a fundraising plan that aims to raise $11.0 million in capital funding from the federal government, corporate donors, and individual community members, and also raise an additional $300,000 annually in operating funding from operations and public and private sector partners. The goal is a larger and better resourced organization that can confidently face a future of service and innovative programming to even more diverse audiences. For example, the face of the Black communities in Toronto is changing. Whereas the communities were largely of Caribbean descent, English speaking and Judeo-Christian, increasingly today’s Black residents may be of continental African descent, Arabic or French speaking, and multi-faith. It is an exciting time to serve Black and other  communities in this city.
As the UN Decade for People of African Descent comes to a close on December 31, 2024, BCC is proud to have spent much of that time preparing to occupy a historically significant space to honour the past and lay the foundation for a future worthy of past sacrifices and achievements. 





Capital Fundraising

The capital fundraising goal is to raise $11.0 million for the demolition and new building construction of the new 8,300 sq ft Blackhurst Cultural Centre (BCC) facility at 756 Bathurst Street. These funds will be added to the $2.78 million committed by the City of Toronto to reach the $13.8 million needed to complete the project. 
The sources of funds include the federal government, corporate and individual donors, with the following projected profiling:
2023 - 2024
2024 - 2025
2025 - 2026
5,000,000
7,000,000
1,830,000


BCC committed to raise $1.7 million, and submitted funding applications with the federal government totaling $10.3 million in capital funding:
BCC secured a $562,500 sponsorship from the Bank of Montréal towards the capital project and is raising capital funds from an annual, a ‘buy-a-brick’ campaign, and donations from individual community members to raise $1.7 million towards the capital project.
Armed with a support letter from the City of Toronto, BCC submitted a $7.83 million funding request to the Green and Inclusive Community Buildings Program (GICB) at Infrastructure Canada.  BCC has met all formal requirements for the GICB funding and is awaiting a response.
BCC also submitted a $2.5 million funding request to the Cultural Spaces Fund program at Heritage Canada. Program staff confirmed that BCC has met all formal requirements for the funding. However, at least two thirds of the required funding, including the requested funds, must be secured before the funding can be released.

Note that, if the federal funding applications are approved, BCC will have a $1.2 million buffer for unanticipated cost escalations and/or unforeseen expenses (for example, what may be found in the soil once the demolition is completed).





Operating Fundraising

BCC will utilize the additional space and multipurpose design to grow its annual reach from about 14,400 to over 20,000 people by 2025-2026, its first complete year in its new permanent home. This will require the operating budget to grow from about $700,000 to over $1 million annually. BCC’s reach is projected to continue to grow to stabilize at about 30,000 people annually, supported by a $1.5 million annual operating budget.

1,000,000
1,500,000

The additional operating resources will come from the following sources:
BCC secured a $187,500 sponsorship from the Bank of Montréal towards operations. Similar corporate donations are being investigated with a total target of $250,000.
A renewed membership drive, plus the creation of a new membership category that provides an opportunity for mid-career friends of Blackhurst, is expected to generate an additional annual revenue of $75,000.
The savings associated with the current rental alone represent $120,000 that will be reinvested in programming and supporting human resources. The sources of funds mix is also expected to be recalibrated with a larger portion of incoming funds from earned revenue.
BCC will soon launch a new program with the working title ‘Blackhurst Academy’ as a community learning platform that will consolidate and expand its current course offerings, including the introduction of select paid offerings. This initiative is expected to contribute to BCC about $150,000 by 2025 - 2026 of additional annual revenue in combined rent and program-level operating surplus. Other new programming initiatives are expected to attract additional funding of $100,000 annually.

Conclusion

The Blackhurst Cultural Centre (BCC) fundraising plan is a vital component of its effort to construct a new permanent home that will serve as a cornerstone of Black-led cultural infrastructure in Toronto. Toronto is known for its cultural vibrancy, and the new BCC facility will add to this reputation by preserving and promoting the city's rich Black history and providing a platform for the Black community to showcase its creativity and talent.
The $350 million Mirvish Village development project, of which the new BCC facility will be a part, also carries a unique historical significance. The late Ed Mirvish, a prominent businessman and philanthropist, is well known for his legacy in Toronto. Mirvish was the owner of Honest Ed's, a famous discount store that was once an iconic landmark in the city. Honest Ed's was more than just a store - it was a symbol of community and a cultural institution that embodied the spirit of Toronto. The new BCC facility will be located on the eastern perimeter of the Mirvish Village development project, which will preserve the heritage of Honest Ed's through its façade.
The plan is a demonstration of BCC’s commitment to build a larger and better-resourced organization. We are proud to end the UN Decade for People of African Descent more confident of our place in the future of this beautiful city. With the execution of this Plan, BCC  will achieve its goal of creating a lasting legacy of cultural enrichment and community empowerment in Toronto. 
Black Lives Matter. Black Spaces Matter. Black Infrastructure Matters.
